Welcome to the Daily CodeWars Challenge repository! ðŸš€

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of coding exercises from CodeWars that I've been practicing daily. The exercises are organized based on the month and date they were completed.
## Repository Structure

-   **MonthX:** Represents each month, containing folders for each day of the month.
-   **DayX:** Corresponds to each day of the month, containing individual exercise files.
-   **exerciseX.ext:** Represents each CodeWars exercise solved on that specific day, with the file extension corresponding to the programming language used (e.g., .js, .ts).

## How to Navigate

Feel free to explore the repository and check out the solutions to the CodeWars challenges. Each exercise file is named after the CodeWars kata, making it easy to identify the problem.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
